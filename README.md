# Guess a number game

Contributors: @TessC14 and @GabrielleMonaen.

## Project description

We have two games, one console-based `game-cli.js`, and one browser-based `game-gui.js`.

Type a number between 1 and 10 to play, or any other key to exit.

If you correctly guess the same number as the computer, you win!

1. Change directory to folder guess-number: `cd guess-number`.
2. Inside the GitBash, run the app by typing the command: `npm run start`.

To run game in browser:

1. Open index.html in browser
